# 🔍 Deep Research AI — Multi-Source Search & Synthesis Agent  

> **Created by [Brijesh Kargar](https://github.com/brijesh4918)**  
> A next-generation AI Research Agent that performs deep web intelligence gathering across **Google**, **Bing**, and **Reddit**, then synthesizes insights into one coherent, verified answer.

---

## 🚀 Overview  

**Deep Research AI** is a next-generation multi-source research assistant designed to **automate deep web exploration and synthesis**.  
Built using the **LangGraph** framework and **GPT-4o**, it executes a full research pipeline — from searching multiple platforms to summarizing and verifying the final insights in real time.  

No more manual tab-switching or inconsistent answers — this AI agent does it all:  
- 🌐 Fetches top-ranked results from **Google** and **Bing**  
- 💬 Extracts authentic opinions and discussions from **Reddit**  
- 🧠 Analyzes each source individually using **LLM-based reasoning**  
- ⚡ Synthesizes all perspectives into a **context-aware, unified summary**

**Use Case Examples:**  
- 🧑‍💼 Market researchers comparing product feedback across forums  
- 🎓 Students and scholars gathering diverse academic insights  
- 📰 Journalists verifying sources before publication  
- 💡 AI engineers analyzing multi-source data for fine-tuning RAG systems

📦 Installation

# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brijesh4918/deep-research-ai.git
cd deep-research-ai

# 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4️⃣ Configure API keys
# Create a .env file in the root directory with:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_key
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_SECRET=your_reddit_secret


⸻

🧪 Usage

    python deep_search_agent.py

Then type any research query, for example:

    Ask me anything: What are experts saying about generative AI in healthcare?

Console Output Example:

    Starting parallel research process...
    Fetching data from Google, Bing, and Reddit...

✅ Final Synthesized Answer:
Generative AI in healthcare is transforming radiology, diagnostics, and
clinical documentation by improving efficiency and accuracy while raising
concerns around ethics and data privacy.

Type exit anytime to quit.

🧾 Requirements

Before running the agent, ensure you have:

        •	🐍 Python 3.9+
        •	🔑 Valid API keys for OpenAI, SERP API, and Reddit
        •	🌐 Active internet connection (for real-time search)
        •	📦 Installed dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)

⸻

🔮 Future Enhancements

        •	🗣️ Voice-Based Interaction (Speech-to-Search + Voice Response)
        •	📄 Contextual Research via PDF / URL Upload
        •	🧭 Automatic Source Citation Linking
        •	📊 Multi-Source Confidence Scoring

⸻

💡 Why It Stands Out
    
    Unlike typical chatbots or retrieval-augmented systems, Deep Research AI does more than just retrieve — it reasons across multiple platforms, weighing credibility and context like a real human researcher.
    
    It’s your AI-powered research partner, not just a search engine.
